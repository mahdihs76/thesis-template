In recent years, the market for smartphone applications has expanded dramatically, and smartphone users use these applications to perform their daily tasks.
One of the main problems of pharmacies in drug warehouse management is the examination of long-term moments of drug use. The traditional mechanism is not efficient in examining the expiration dates of large-scale drugs. Also, a lot of human resources are spent recording drug information manually and report it. Therefore, by examining the available resources in pharmacies, we will explore a software-based solution that can be implemented based on the operating system of smartphones.
